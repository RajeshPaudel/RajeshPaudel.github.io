        <p>
            A point is scored each time the disc is received in the endzone.  After a point, the team that just scored stays in that endzone and the opposing team moves to the opposite endzone; play is initiated again with a pull by the team that just scored.

        </p>
        <p>
            The disc is in-play as long as it is not grounded, or out of bounds (after the first pull).  Once the play is dead, there is a turnover at the point the disc was grounded or near to where it went out of bounds.
